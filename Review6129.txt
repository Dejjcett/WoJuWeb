Reviewer 4 of CASE 2017 submission 10

Comments to the author
======================

This paper needs to be read again.

Regarding the abstract:
I believe that in order to write that the historical fault
data confirm a claim, the authors need to prove that claim
or need to cite some other papers.

In the first part of the introduction the problem related
to the reliability of the spreaders must be explain better.
Moreover, in the last part of the introduction, the authors
have to clarify better the presentation of the results. 

Section II
check better formula (1), in my opinion the authors cannot
write that 
log_2 n = ln n.
In formula (1), all the variables must be defined
accurately.
The definition of N and &#916;N are not clear to me.

The comments at the end of Section II, between formula (5)
and the end of this section is not clear to me.

Section III.
The author have to justify why they use the Correlation
Coefficient Method. They need to give some references about
the method and about the use of it.

Section III.
Explain better why Weibull distribution with 3 parameters
cannot be used.

Fig.2 must be improved.

Last part of the paper, the second part of Section III and
all Section IV must be improved and clarified better.

I believe that this paper cannot be accepted now, 
unless the editor will ask the authors to improve it.
