Reviewer 2 of CASE 2017 submission 10

Comments to the author
======================

In the chapter II.B, When you estimate the three parameter
of the Weibull distribution, you mentioned about some
methods to get them. However, there is no evidence to back
up your opinions about their strength and weakness. So you
had better put some reference for the methods. I could not
understand what the novelty of your paper is because the
Weibull distribution is very well known the probability
distribution.
